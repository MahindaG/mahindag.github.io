## How I Work

I focus on clarity, collaboration, and delivery. I start by understanding the problem and defining success before moving into execution.

- **Problem-first mindset** — I clarify goals, constraints, and success metrics before proposing solutions.  
- **Collaborative by default** — I work closely with stakeholders and technical teams to align priorities and expectations.  
- **Data-informed decisions** — I use analysis, dashboards, and insights to guide trade-offs and validate direction.  
- **Iterative delivery** — I break work into manageable phases, deliver incrementally, and refine based on feedback.  
- **Clear communication** — I value concise documentation, transparent updates, and shared understanding across teams.
